Macro for batch processing files using [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Welcome) or [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji)

## SignalRatio.ijm

This is a macro that will process a batch of single-channel fluorescent pictures and compare the specific fluorescence (intense values) to the overall general fluorescence.

The script goes as follows:
  1. Convert the color channel to 16bit
  2. (optional) Set a scale
  3. Get the total area of gray pixels using a low-intensity threshold value (get as much as fluorescence signal as possible)
  4. Get the specific area of high pixel intensity using a high threshold value (get only the specific signal)
  5. Calculate the signal ratio (High/low*100)
  6. Export a `Result.csv` file in the output folder

**How to Run:**
Get the SignalRatio.ijm file from GitHub.
In Image/Fiji go to `Plugins>Macro>edit`, select the file and click on run.
For some reason, it doesn't want to run with the run option but run fine through the editor.

**What to do before running the macro:**
1. Select an image or two with a positive signal
2. Transform the image into a 16bit grayscale through `Image>Type>16-bit`
3. Adjust the threshold through `Image>Adjust>Threshold` and select a window of value that will highlight most of the green signal with a minimum of noise.
4. copy those value on in the command `setThreshold(x, y);` on line 41
5. Repeat the threshold adjustment to have only your positive (peak) signal and change the x,y value in `setThreshold(x, y);` on line 49.
6. (Optional): check that the peak values are not overlapping too much with a negative control

Optional: If you know the scale of your picture (x pixel is y nm) you can edit line 36:
`run("Set Scale...", "distance=x known=y unit=pixel");`
And edit how many pixels corresponds to how many units, this will adjust the right area measurement.
Default is pixel size.

**Output:**
The macro output for each files three lines, the first gives the General values, then the Peak and finally the ratio on the third line.
Output files as the following format:

 ````
 ,Label,Area,Mean,Min,Max,MinThr,MaxThr,Type,SR
1,hfd d9 dc3-1.tif,834593,12.651,8,85,8,65535,General,0.000
2,hfd d9 dc3-1.tif,12077,56.020,40,85,40,65535,Peak,0.000
3,hfd d9 dc3.tif,0,0.000,0,0,0,0,Signal Ratio,1.447
````
**Column details:**
- First column: Column id
- `Label`: file name
- `Area`: Area in pixel (or in square unit if you adjusted the script)
- `Mean`: Mean pixel intensity in the area
- `Min`: Min pixel intensity in the area
- `Max`: Max pixel intensity in the area
- `MinThr`: Min threshold value used
- `MaxThr`: Max threshold value used
- `Type`: What Type of measurment, will be `General`,`Peak` or `Signal Ratio`
- `SR`: Signal Ratio value in percent

### Want to run this manually?
You can run the script manually following these steps:
1. Set picture scale if needed through `Analyze>Set scale`
2. Transform you color picture in a grayscale 16-bit by clicking on `Image>Type>16-bit`
3. Set the measurement information you need by clicking on `Analyze>Set Measurements`
    - You'll want to tick:  `Area`,`Mean gray value`,`Min & Max gray value`, `Limit to threshold` and `Display label`
4. Adjust the threshold through `Image>Adjust>Threshold` and select a window of value that will highlight most of the green signal with a minimum of noise.
5. Click on `Analyze>Measurement` or press `command + m`
6. Repeat the threshold adjustment to have only your positive (peak) signal 
7. Click on `Analyze>Measurement` or press `command + m`
8. Repeat for all images
9. Once you've done this, you can export the result window by `left-clicking` and `Select all`, then copying and pasting the result into an Excel file.

**Optional:** You don't want to select the whole image. In this case, you can use the lasso tool and select your Region of Interest before `Step 4`. 

## ImageProcessor2.ijm

Process a set of `nd2` pictures in a set folder. At the moment, the script assumes each picture has three channels: one with DAPI for nuclei detection, one called cell for detecting cell shape, and one called signal for the fluorescence of interest.

The script goes as follows:
1. Ask the user the folder to process
2. Ask which channel is which
3. Correct background fluorescence
4. Split channel to individual pictures
5. Process the nucleus channel to create a mask
6. Process signal channel to create a mask
7. If possible, create a cytoplasm mask by subtracting the nucleus channel to the whole cell one.
8. Measure signal intensity for each channel
9. Count cells by counting the number of nuclei on the respective channel
10. Measure shape parameters with the cell channel, see detail below
11. Print all results to a `results_file.csv`

### In case of missing signal

The script detects the presence or not of a signal and reports if something is missing in the `Note` column of the corresponding file in the `results_file.csv`. Please advise if you see the comment. Additionally, with a large number of overlapping cells, the value could be skewed and meaningless. Inspect the picture beforehand before considering using this value. Compare the `Cell Number (Nuclei)` and `Cell Number (Cell)` column counts, if there is a big discrepancy consider not taking account of shape value.

### Shape parameters measurement

Because treatment can affect cell shape, we measure a set of basic shape indicator with the cell channels. The parameters are:

**Circularity:**

Formula: $Circularity=(4ùúã√óArea)/Perimeter^2$
Range: 0 to 1
Interpretation: A value of 1 indicates a perfect circle. Values closer to 0 indicate shapes that are less circular (more elongated or irregular).

**Aspect Ratio (AR):**

Formula: $Aspect¬†Ratio=(Major¬†Axis¬†Length)/(Minor¬†Axis¬†Length)$
Interpretation: The aspect ratio describes the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of the best-fitting ellipse for the particle. Values greater than 1 indicate elongated shapes.

**Roundness:**
Formula: $Roundness=(4√óArea)/(ùúã√óMajor¬†Axis¬†Length^2)$
 
Interpretation: Similar to circularity but normalized by the major axis length. Higher values indicate rounder shapes.

### Output

The `results_file.csv` has the following columns:

- `ID`: Image name
- `Nucleus Area` : Area of all detected nuclei in pixel
- `Nucleus Signal` : Average signal in the Nucleus area
- `Whole Cell Area` : Area of all the detected cells in pixel
- `Whole cell signal` : Average signal in the Nucleus area
- `Cytoplasm Area` : Area of all the detected Cytoplasm in pixel
- `Cytoplasm signal` : Average signal in the Cytoplasm area
- `Cell Number (Nuclei)` : Number of cells based on Nuceli count
- `Cell Number (Cells)` : Number of cells based on Cell channel count (less reliable)
- `Mean Circularity` : Average Circularity value
- `Mean AR` : Average Aspect Ratio value
- `Mean Roundness` : Average Roundness value
- `Note` : If an issue with signal detection happens, report it here.
